The jupyter notebook "FINAL WEDGE" holds includes all parts of the project (intial setup, part 2, and part 3).

PS: Sorry if the line ---  os.listdir("clean-files") --- has output code. I had it closed in my jupyter notebook.

## Feedback

First, since you changed `submission.md` to `submission.txt` now it doesn't render in github! C'mon man. But I can deal.

Part 1 all looks good. 

For Part 2, you should have that `import random` at the top (all imports at the top is the standard). I'd also
recommend doing tab-delimited files rather than commas to avoid the hassles of the commas-in-descriptions that
we had with cleaning. 

For Part 3, it'd be better if you had good names for the tables (e.g., `owner_year_month` instead of `table2`). Nice
work getting that query to work. 

Good job, you're done! Consider this **complete**.
