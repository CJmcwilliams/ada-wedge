## Query Comparison Results

Fill in the following table with the results from the 
queries contained in `gbq_assessment_query.sql`. You only
need to fill in relative difference on the rows where it applies. 
When calculating relative difference, use the formula 
` (your_results - my_results)/my_results)`.

## Reflections

<!-- I'd love to get 100-200 words on your experience doing the Wedge Project --> 

The Wedge Project introduced me to the biggest "dataset" I have ever worked with. While it was a challenge, I also learned a ton! The biggest challenge for me was just getting started. It seemed like such a HUGE project in the beginning so I wasn't sure how to even get started. I think connecting with GBQ and setting up the JSON in class was very beneficial because those parts were a little confusing. Reading and going through the exercises pointed me in the right direction to get started. I felt like this was definitely a project that I couldn't do by myself. I needed help from John and my classmates to get it completed. I thought it was super cool learning how to connect all of these programs. I hope I get to use GBQ in the future because it really is a powerful program.
